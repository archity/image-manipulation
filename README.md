# Image Manipulation
Repository for documenting about some of the image manipulation techniques using Python and other open-source libraries.

## 1. Instance Segmentation and Object Detection

* Make use of [pixellib](https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib) library
* Use of a Mask R-CNN model
    * trained on coco dataset
  

## 2. [Basic Image Manipulation using Pillow](./basic-image-pillow.ipynb)

Some basic `PIL` functions for image processing

* Merge two images
* Add/subtract two images
* Convert to grayscale
* Convert to Black-and-White
* Colour Inversion
* Rotation
* Gaussian Blur
* Edge Detection
